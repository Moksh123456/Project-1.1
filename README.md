# Hardware Simulation Project

## Overview

This project involves creating and testing hardware components using HDL (Hardware Description Language). The primary goal is to simulate and verify the behavior of basic logic gates like NOT and OR using the hardware simulator.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
nand2tetris
│
└── Projects
    └── 01
        ├── Not.hdl
        ├── Not.tst
        ├── Or.hdl
        └── Or.tst
```

- **Not.hdl**: HDL file defining the NOT gate.
- **Not.tst**: Test script for the NOT gate.
- **Or.hdl**: HDL file defining the OR gate.
- **Or.tst**: Test script for the OR gate.

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Open the Hardware Simulator:**
   - Launch the hardware simulator application that you have downloaded.

2. **Load the HDL Chip File:**
   - Open the HDL file from the "Projects" folder. For example:
     ```
     nand2tetris -> Projects -> 01 -> Not.hdl
     ```
   - You can also load other HDL files such as `Or.hdl` following the same path.

3. **Load the Test Script:**
   - Navigate to the "Projects" folder and open the corresponding test script. For example:
     ```
     nand2tetris -> Projects -> 01 -> Not.tst
     ```
   - Similarly, you can load other test scripts like `Or.tst`.

4. **Run the Test:**
   - Execute the test script in the hardware simulator to test the HDL chip's behavior. The simulator will show you whether the actual outputs match the expected outputs defined in the test script.

5. **Edit HDL Files:**
   - If modifications are needed, open the HDL files in any text editor such as Notepad or VS Code. Make your changes, save the file, and reload it in the hardware simulator to test the updates.

## Requirements

- **Hardware Simulator**: Ensure you have the hardware simulator application installed.
- **Text Editor**: Any text editor for editing HDL files (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).

## Troubleshooting

- **Simulator Errors**: Check that the HDL files are correctly written and that the test scripts match the expected input and output.
- **File Paths**: Ensure that you are opening the correct files from the specified paths.
